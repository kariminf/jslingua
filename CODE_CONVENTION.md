# JsLingua Coding Convention

## File naming

- All the modules must be in the racine
- Each language has a folder with 3 letters: ara, eng, fra, jpn, etc.
- In each, the name of each implementation must be: <lang-code>.<module>.js.
Example: ara.morpho.js
- All minuscule

## Modules

- Class names starts with Majuscule. e.g. Morpho.
- Class names for implementations are CamelCase, starting with language code then module name.
e.g. AraMorho.
- A module exports a class, which we can then instantiate.

## Variables

- their names are camelCase
- use always "let"; no "var" NOOOOOOO "var" I repeat
- if they are local, they can be long (since, they can be shorten using uglify-js)
- if they are bounded to the class, keep them short (eg, this.result ==> this.res)

## Constantes

- their names: MAJ_LIKE_THIS
- use "const", no "var", I repeat: no "var"

## Functions

- their names camelCase
- if the function is private, its name's length doesn't matter
- if it is protected, shorten
- if it is public, use two versions: short and long (the long one just uses the short)
- the shortened functions are all minuscule
- if they are private (local) start with " __ "
- if they are protected, start with " _ "

Here a list of function beginnings in shorten version:

- l: list available values. For example, to list available stemming methods: Morpho.lstem()
- n: new. For example: JsLingua.nserv("morpho", "eng").
- g: get. Fore example: engMorpho.gstemdesc("porter");
- s: set. For example: engMorpho.sstem("porter");
- a: add a method. Usually, the function is protected
